# Code Assistants

Skills and agents for AI-assisted development workflows — plan, implement, commit, PR, and monitor.

## Plugins

- [**autopilot**](./claude-plugins/autopilot/README.md) — plan, implement, commit, PR, and monitor
  - [Upgrade notes](./claude-plugins/autopilot/MIGRATING.md)

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add awinogradov/code-assistants
/plugin install autopilot@code-assistants
```

See the [plugin README](./claude-plugins/autopilot/README.md#installation) for scoping options and local development.

## Repository docs

- [Workspace structure](./docs/workspace-structure.md) — where new actions, packages, and apps go, and how they wire into Turbo
- [`agents` field spec](./docs/agents-field.md) — how skills detect a repository's tech stack from `package.json`
- [`release` field spec](./docs/release-field.md) — how `release-action` picks the right artifacts for npm packages, GitHub Actions, and Claude plugins
- [Release auto-merge flow](./docs/release-automerge.md) — the event-driven action that merges approved, all-green release PRs, and how its workflow is propagated downstream
- [Committed Repomix pack](./docs/repomix-pack.md) — the `.repomix/pack.xml` snapshot, the merge-triggered workflow that refreshes it, and the snapshot-first contract skills follow
- [Stack rule sets](./rules/) — `Bun`, `Bun+React+Tailwind`, `NodeJS+React`, `NodeJS+React+Tailwind`

## GitHub Actions

- [`files-sync`](./.github/actions/files-sync/README.md) — sync declared files from upstream repos and open one PR with the differences
- [`agents-rules-sync`](./.github/actions/agents-rules-sync/README.md) — sync the stack-appropriate `rules/<stack>.md` into `CLAUDE.md` based on `package.json` `agents.rules`
- [`contributing-check`](./.github/actions/contributing-check/README.md) — validate branch name, commit messages, and PR title against `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [`contributing-sync`](./.github/actions/contributing-sync/README.md) — sync `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `LICENSE.md`, and the contributing workflow from upstream
- [`release-action`](./.github/actions/release-action/README.md) — conventional-commit-driven release pipeline for npm packages, GitHub Actions, and Claude plugins
- [`release-automerge`](./.github/actions/release-automerge/README.md) — merge an approved, all-green release PR (`^release-`), driven by an event-based workflow so `publish.yml` runs without a manual click
- [`code-review-action`](./.github/actions/code-review-action/README.md) — AI code review for pull requests via Claude Code, with a react mode for replying to bot mentions
- [`repomix-sync`](./.github/actions/repomix-sync/README.md) — sync the `repomix-pack` workflow and `repomix.config.json` from upstream so each consumer commits its own codebase snapshot
- [`release-automerge-sync`](./.github/actions/release-automerge-sync/README.md) — sync the `release-automerge` workflow from upstream so each consumer auto-merges its own release PRs
